# Release v0.2.0: Full-Stack API Implementation

## Overview

This major release transforms the JB SQUARE platform from a prototype with limited scope to a comprehensive, full-stack application with a nearly complete API backend and integrated frontend components. Based on a detailed OpenAPI specification, this version introduces a complete mock backend for all major domains and connects several key frontend pages to this new API, replacing previous mock data implementations.

The primary goal of this release is to establish the full data architecture of the application and provide a feature-rich, data-driven user experience for core functionalities.

### Key Features & Enhancements

#### Backend (FastAPI)
*   **Full API Implementation**: Implemented a complete mock backend for the API defined in the `openapi.yml` specification.
*   **Modular Routers**: Created new, modular routers for all major API domains: Support Programs, Incubation Centers, Technologies, Education, Mentors, and Search.
*   **Robust Data Modeling**: Developed Pydantic models for all API schemas, ensuring data validation and consistency.
*   **Auth & User Management**: Refactored the `auth` and `users` routers and implemented a full suite of endpoints for registration, login, password reset, and user profile management.
*   **Admin Functionality**: Added a comprehensive set of admin endpoints for user management and registration approval.
*   **Mock Data & SQL**: Provided mock data and sample SQL `CREATE TABLE` schemas for all new models.

#### Frontend (React)
*   **Live Data Integration**: Refactored several key pages to fetch data from the new live backend API, replacing all previous mock data.
    *   **Support Programs Page**: Now displays live data from `/api/support-programs`.
    *   **Incubation Centers Page**: Now displays live data from `/api/incubation-centers`.
    *   **Technologies & Patents Page**: Now displays live data from `/api/tech-summary/list`.
*   **Consistent Data Fetching**: Established a unified data-fetching pattern by creating and using custom React hooks (`useSupportPrograms`, `useIncubationCenters`, etc.).
*   **Component Refactoring**: Updated and refactored numerous UI components (`AnnouncementListItem`, `TenantCard`, etc.) to align with the new, consistent data models provided by the backend API.
*   **Build Error Resolution**: Systematically identified and fixed numerous TypeScript and JSX build errors, significantly improving code quality and stability.

#### API Documentation
*   **Redoc Viewer**: Added a new API documentation page at `/redoc.html`, which uses Redoc to render the `openapi.yml` specification, providing a clear and interactive reference for developers.

### Technical Notes
*   **Backend Validation**: The backend successfully passes a "build test" (dependency installation and server initialization), confirming its runnability.
*   **Git Ignore**: Corrected the Git index to properly ignore `__pycache__` directories as defined in the `.gitignore` file.
*   **Full-Stack Connectivity**: This release marks the first time the frontend and backend are connected for a majority of the application's features, laying the groundwork for future development.

    *   The `README.md` has been significantly improved with clear, professional instructions for setting up the development environment.
    *   Documented the **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** setup, which is the recommended workflow for frontend development.

### Technical Notes

*   **Backend:** The FastAPI backend now includes distinct data models and API endpoints for `News` and `E-vents`.
*   **Frontend:** The React application now uses `swr` for data fetching and is configured to work seamlessly with the MSW mock API.
